# holiday-server-pack - packwiz edition

This is a packwiz project to manage the modpack for client and server - designed for people who just want to have a "known working" set of optimization and QOL mods.

### Can I submit mod X?

We aren't looking to have every mod ever, but also do not want people to feel left out. If you develop a mod that you think would be a good fit for the server pack, feel free to submit it.

If you aren't a mod developer, or a developer who thinks that a third party mod is critical for the server, please submit a PR and we can discuss it as a group. We are not trying to build a kitchen sink pack of well known popular mods, but also want to make sure that the server is fun and engaging for everyone.

If your mod does not play well with other mods or is a total conversion, it may be best to not submit it this time around.

Any mods added must have a license that allows for redistribution.

### Submitting a mod

If your mod is designed for the client and server, submit your mod to the [main repo](https://github.com/modmuss50/holiday-server-pack).

Clientside mods can be suggested here via GitHub issues and PRs.

### Building and testing the modpack

To build a Modrinth modpack file run `packwiz mr export`. The modpack is available as a Modrinth pack via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cassiancc/Holiday-Server-Packwiz/actions) and an [auto-updating MultiMC/Prism Launcher instance](https://holiday-server-pack.cassian.cc/).
